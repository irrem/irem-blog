      I am a 2nd year computer engineering student at Gazi University. I've
      worked hard to find the area that interests me. I have worked with
      technologies in different fields. I used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
      applications because I was interested in graphic design and painting, and
      I also learned Figma because I needed it while developing a project. In
      the field of coding, I developed games with Unity, tried mobile
      applications with Java and Kotlin, made windows form applications with C#
      and even coded php for a while. I am currently actively coding React js.
